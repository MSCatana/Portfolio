# Problem Solving

This folder contains my personal collection of programming problems solved in C (and possibly other languages).  
The problems are primarily sourced from the [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/) newsletter.

## Purpose

The goal of this collection is to:
- Improve my problem-solving and coding skills through regular practice.
- Build a well-documented portfolio of diverse algorithmic challenges.
- Maintain clean, readable, and well-documented code.

## Structure

- Each problem is saved in its own source file.
- Each file includes a detailed header with:
  - Problem description
  - Source or reference link (if available)
  - My approach and key design choices
  - Notes on assumptions and edge cases

## Disclaimer

All solutions are written entirely by me without using AI-generated code or solution lookups.  
I aim to solve each problem fully on my own to strengthen my skills.

## Source

Most problems come from [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/), which sends daily interview-style challenges by email.
