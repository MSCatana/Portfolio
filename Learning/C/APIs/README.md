# APIs

This folder contains reusable API modules and utility code designed for easy integration into various projects.

## Purpose

The code here is structured to provide clean, modular interfaces for common tasks or components, enabling efficient reuse and reducing duplication across projects.

## Structure

- Each API module is contained in its own folder or file, depending on complexity.
- Modules are documented with:
  - Purpose and functionality
  - Public interfaces (functions, classes, etc.)
  - Usage examples (when applicable)
  - Design considerations and limitations

## Usage

These APIs are designed to be imported or linked into other projects with minimal dependencies and configuration.  
Before integrating, review the moduleâ€™s documentation and test cases to ensure compatibility with your project requirements.

## Best Practices

- Follow consistent naming conventions and coding standards within the API code.
- Write clear and minimal interfaces focused on specific tasks.
- Include error handling and input validation where appropriate.
- Keep dependencies minimal to maximize portability.
